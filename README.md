This is my code for the robot I made for the 2023 First Tech Challenge game, Centerstage.

please note three things:
- it is in Python, I realize FTC usally uses Java but its just what I personally used
- This was *actually* coded in Vex V5 python code which is why it might be crappy and have errors
- This was apart of one of my class assigments, not from a actual FTC team, hence why I used Vex
